# Youtube-Subscriber-counter
I made this a few months ago and I found it on my computer, so why not publishing it on github ?

to use this you need to have googleapiclient installed, for this type this your terminal : pip install google-api-python-client
also you need to get your youtube channel's id here is how : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvd3ukbrdL0
and the last thing you need is an api key you can get one here : https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3

once all done you need to change the api_key value (line 6) to your api key then run the python file and type your channel's id!
